If anybody wants it here is my basic MFP integration example.

If you don't have it install https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/dotnet/8.0
Unzip it somewhere.
Open a Voxta chat with character of your choice [see susie below as one option]
run the start.bat which should kick off the included copy of MFP.
Adjust the MFP output for your sex toy/bus driver/anything else you want to run. There is a handy output which will connect to the online service but buttplug/intiface central and bluetooth works better.
