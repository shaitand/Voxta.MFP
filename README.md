<h1>If anybody wants it here is my basic MFP integration example.</h1>

<li>If you don't have it install https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/dotnet/8.0</li>
<li>Unzip it somewhere.</li>
<li>Open a Voxta chat with character of your choice [see susie below as one option]</li>
<li>run the start.bat which should kick off the included copy of MFP.</li>
<li>Adjust the MFP output for your sex toy/bus driver/anything else you want to run. There is a handy output which will connect to the online service but buttplug/intiface central and bluetooth works better.</li>
